### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/KEexxjxK16lBoE162o/giphy.gif" width="70px">, I am Ashley!

Iâ€™m currently studying Software Engineering at Springboard, and Iâ€™m seeking out-of-state opportunities in Software Engineering and possibly even apparel companies.

Iâ€™ve been Graphic Designer with 7 years of experience in the design industry. Iâ€™ve taken charge of the packaging for some of the major tailored menswear brands including Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger, and Hart Schaffner Marx. As I see the world is evolving away from static paper packaging, I decided to pursue a major career pivot to Software Engineering.

My technical abilities:
Javascript â€¢ HTML5 â€¢ CSS â€¢ VS Code â€¢ DOM Manipulation â€¢ APIs/AJAX â€¢ Git/GitHub â€¢ Jasmine Testing â€¢ ES2015 â€¢ Twitter Bootstrap â€¢ jQuery â€¢ Python â€¢ Flask â€¢ Hosting
